# Advent of Code 2022

Back again. I had so much fun with Ruby [last year](https://github.com/georgiee/advent-of-code-2021).
No time this year because the mornings are busy â€” so I'm prepared to fail early after I had worked on awesome 24 days last time.

+ [Day 01](day-01/)
+ [Day 02](day-02/)
+ [Day 03](day-03/)
+ [Day 04](day-04/)
+ [Day 05](day-05/)
+ [Day 06](day-06/) (super fast âœ¨)
+ [Day 07](day-07/) (tough one ðŸ˜°)
+ [Day 08](day-08/)
+ [Day 09](day-09/) (part 2 failed, time is up)
+ [Day 10](day-10/) (weekend bump, no time)
+ [Day 11](day-11/) (weekend bump, no time)

I think that's the turning point of this year. My personal time constraints don't fit the required amount of time to work on it.
