# Advent of Code 2022

Back again. I had so much fun with Ruby [last year](https://github.com/georgiee/advent-of-code-2021).
No time this year because the mornings are busy — so I'm prepared to fail early after I had worked on awesome 24 days last time.

+ [Day 01](day-01/)
+ [Day 02](day-02/)
+ [Day 03](day-03/)
+ [Day 04](day-04/)
+ [Day 05](day-05/) 
+ [Day 06](day-06/) (super fast ✨)

## Neat things I learned
Let's see if I learn as much as last year.
